Application of smart technology in sustainable agricultural practices

The integration of smart technology in agriculture encompasses innovations such as sensor technology, machine learning, and positioning systems to analyze vegetation, soil properties, and landscape topography. With growing environmental pressures, sustainable agricultural practices are increasingly crucial, necessitating a thorough understanding of both surface and subsurface characteristics.

In non-destructive testing, Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) is commonly employed to investigate subsurface properties, while Electromagnetic Induction (EMI) complements GPR findings. For surface analysis, aerial photogrammetry is utilized. This project focuses on applying these smart technologies—EMI, GPR, and drone technology—to study the research farm plots at UCLouvain.

The main goal of this project is to characterize the study area according to its surface and sub-surface properties. Specific objectives include:

1. Analyzing soil properties using EMI.
2. Assessing surface characteristics through photogrammetry (topography and orthophoto).
3. Investigating subsoil properties with GPR.
